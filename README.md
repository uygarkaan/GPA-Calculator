## GPA Calculator

## Project Overview

The **GPA Calculator** is a simple Java-based application that calculates the Grade Point Average (GPA) for a set of courses. This program prompts the user to input their average grades for a list of subjects and computes the overall GPA by averaging these values.

## Features

- **User Input:** The program uses the `Scanner` class to accept user input for each subject's average grade.
- **Calculation:** The GPA is calculated by summing all the input grades and dividing by the total number of subjects.
- **Output:** The program displays the final GPA on the console.

## Code Explanation

Here's a brief overview of the key components in the code:

- **Variable Declarations:** Each subject's average is stored in a `double` variable.
- **Input Gathering:** The program asks the user to enter their average grades for subjects such as Math, Turkish, Chemistry, Physics, Philosophy, Geography, History, Foreign Language, and Music.
- **GPA Calculation:** The program sums all the input grades and divides by the number of subjects to calculate the GPA.
- **Output:** The final GPA is displayed to the user.
